# CRED_Finance_MVP
 
CRED, an Indian startup that provides a credit card bill payment app allowing users to integrate all their credit cards onto a single platform and manage them seamlessly. As credit card users represent the top 5% of society, CRED's lucrative user base presents many opportunities for product enhancements such as stock investments, financial consulting, NFT marketplaces, and crypto trading.

In my opinion, CRED is trying to create an irreversible behavioral shift in their users by providing them with the convenience of managing their credit cards seamlessly, which has enabled them to build a huge user base with massive potential for future prospects.

I have detailed my thoughts in a Medium article, which you can check out using the following link:[ https://lnkd.in/gFzvDrdP](https://medium.com/@hrithik.18/cred-product-teardown-c9efb86059f8)

As part of CRED's phase 1 product enhancement program, I chose stock investments as a potential feature to deploy on their platform due to its massive rise in popularity. One of the main problems with stock investments is the difficulty in picking which stocks to invest in. I tried to address this problem by proposing a solution with CRED's stock investment platform.

Furthermore, I designed the UI using Figma, and you can view it using the following link: [https://lnkd.in/gr2qzJiW](https://www.figma.com/file/fzlGO5v2hBXoR3dueDfsDi/CRED-Finance-Prototype?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)https://www.figma.com/file/fzlGO5v2hBXoR3dueDfsDi/CRED-Finance-Prototype?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design

I also created a UI walkthrough video, which you can view here: [https://lnkd.in/grg56QKF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YRjwjG9WfR1ws1Mx3OA2upHxjt7h0m82/view)https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YRjwjG9WfR1ws1Mx3OA2upHxjt7h0m82/view
